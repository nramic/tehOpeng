### How to use
Step 1:
Ensure that you have all these files in the same folder
``homo2.py``
``util.py``
football_left.mp4, football_mid.mp4, football_right.mp4
``ExtractBackground.py``

Step 2:
Run ``homo2.py`` to generate individual frames image of stitched video
Run ``ExtractBackground.py`` to get output

Explanation:
homo2.py (with the help of util.py) takes in the three football videos and * stitches them into one video and then generates individual video frames. It * can take quite awhile, roughly 2-3 hours and can take up quite a big of
space, roughly 8GB.

ExtractBackground.py then reads in the frames generated and output the topdown view and tracking of the players on the field
